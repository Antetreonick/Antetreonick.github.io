<p>Just like how matter is compressed energy, souls are soul energy but compressed. A soul has infinite soul energy. A technique needs a soul to function. Souls are needed to perform a technique as souls with bodies can convert that soul energy into actual kinetic energy, potential energy etc. however you can use soul energy to distort space and time which is done by creating small bursts of soul energy. One can sacrifice their soul energy to output a massive amount of soul energy which is only a one time use. One can do a specific ritual to give their soul energy to somebody else. Soul energy can be used to blast souls away. A soul’s determination and willpower can make them have more “mass” meaning they can’t be moved easily using Soul Energy. After a massive soul energy output, a soul would “heat” up which can kill the person. Soul “heat” can kill the person due to the soul vibrating too much and disconnecting from the body. Soul Energy can be used to move Souls and even damage them by releasing extreme amounts of Soul Energy.## limits of soul energy outputSouls have limits at releasing soul energy, classified into - “very low soul energy output (VLSET)”- “low soul energy output (LSET)”- “medium soul energy output (MSET)”- “high soul energy output (HSET)”- “very high soul energy output (VHSET)”- “highest soul energy outputs (HSETS)”- "highest in all time energy outputs (HIATETS)"For scale, if MSET person can lift 50 ton by using “physical amplification” group techniques, then (without considering strength without the techniques): - VLSET: able to lift 500 kg.- LSET: able to lift 1 ton.- MSET: able to lift 50 tons.- HSET: able to lift 500 tons.- VHSET: able to lift 5 kilotons.- HSET: able to lift 500 kilotons…- HIATETS: able to lift 10^8 tons.Only 40 beings have been recorded having HIATETS.# InfoThe universe is created by The God. The God created The Influence which is a system that can convert souls into soul energy (E = mc^2) and the soul energy of a soul is unfathomably huge. The Anomaly watches the universe created by The God. The God does not know what or who The Anomaly is but it knows some presence is watching. The Anomaly is unfathomably more powerful than The God and is outside the universe itself.# TechniquesTechniques are the use of soul energy in specific ways to complete a task. There are simple techniques, middle techniques, master techniques, ultimate techniques, maximum techniques.## simple techniquestechniques that are simple to learn and use. For example, “outward burst” technique is a simple technique where the user converts soul energy to kinetic energy and pushes it outward from their hands creating an energetic explosion that radiates outwards from their hands.## middle techniquestechniques that require some effort to learn and use. For example, “punch amplification” is a middle technique where the user converts soul energy into kinetic energy and puts it in their punches to boost their speed.## master techniquesMaster techniques are techniques which require years of hardwork and training to do. An example is “death giver” from “life and death manipulation” group which is a technique which works by using the soul energy to blast away souls from their body.## ultimate techniquesUltimate techniques require decades of training to do. “spatial cut” from time-space manipulation group is an example for it where the user must use the soul energy in a way to cut the space where they want to which can cut anything.## maximum techniquesMaximum techniques require insane amounts of determination, willpower, hardwork and training for decades to perform. “collapse” is an example from the “telekinesis” group where the user converts the soul energy to kinetic energy, spreads it across an area and crush the matter around it and it’s area ranges from 1m to 2km depending on the mastery of it.## groups of techniquesgroups of techniques are groups used to classify techniques for convenience. Such groups are “life and death manipulation”, “telekinesis”, “physical amplification”, “puppet master” etc.# The GodThe God is a being who considered to be the source of benevolence, creation and destruction, malevolence and honesty.# The AnomalyThe Anomaly is Miany, transcending The God, the universe the god created infinitely. # HistoryThousands of years ago, VLSET and LSET people were considered to be the lowest of value and were slaves of the higher soul energy output people. However, after thousands of years of slavery, VLSET, LSET and even some HSET and VHSET people supporting them held protests. The protests were peaceful but turned violent after the MSET and HSET people attacked them. After hundreds of years of protesting and more and more people with high soul energy outputs began supporting them, all the people were considered equal.Thousands of years later, after civilizations came and fell, modern civilizations appeared. There, people with VLSET and LSET were 80% of the ones who were drug dealers, terrorists, rebels, and corrupt government officials. After decades, the government and higher soul energy output people began to attack people with VLSET and LSET (The Government was becoming corrupt). In one of those attacks, a child’s parents got killed. The Child’s name was Hideki, he had LSET. Hideki managed to survive and hide in the forest for 4 weeks. Later, a soul energy group of techniques teacher found him. The teacher’s name was Satoshi, he was a calm, and wise man, always smiling and looked determined. Satoshi teached techniques in the “Time-Space manipulation” group.Satoshi, wore clothes that were white, long rectangular shaped (length:breadth ratio = 20:1) which using telekinesis technique, never fell. The cloth that wrapped around him formed a clothes shape that martial arts teachers in the old eras wore.Satoshi decided to teach Hideki techniques in “Time-Space manipulation” group. To Satoshi’s surprise, Hideki learned techniques that usually took decades to learn in just months. The reason was that Hideki’s soul was insanely determined and had insane amounts of willpower. Satoshi saw a god in Hideki, a god who can learn anything and everything in a very short amount of time. Satoshi put most of his time in training Hideki and teaching him good morals.After decades of training, Hideki had mastered spatial cuts and travelling cut, spatial destruction (50 m cubed volume), spatial mapping (max area 50 m) which allows him to see anything even colors within the specified radius using the small distortions of space caused by matter, spatial collapse and expansion (can only collapse and expand things that softer than 200x the hardness of diamond), telekinesis (max range = 5km, strength = capable of lifting 5 kilotons),  teleportation (max range = 50km) and omnipresence (500m radius) which puts a very large number of imaginary points within the volume of approximately a sphere with the radius of the specified radius and attacks can come from the points. The amount of points for Hideki is an insanely large number (You have to have at least 5000 points in a 5 cm cubed space within the radius) even though he is a LSET person. Satoshi gave him an ancient book that explains how Soul Energy works and time-space manipulation in detail. The book was about 1 foot long and 0.35 foot wide and 0.8 foot thick with small text. One day, Satoshi went shopping and didn’t return for 5 hours. Hideki, being concerned went in the direction Satoshi went, which was the city area, he saw huge clouds of smoke. When he reached the city, to his horror, the city was completely annihilated and Satoshi presumably killed. This gave Hideki a flashback of when his parents died. Hideki’s mind completely collapsed on the moment he realized that Satoshi likely died. He searched for him desperately but never found him.Hideki in the middle of the city, felt something snap in him. He secretly watched the cities and saw words on televisions and speech but they made no difference. It was at this point, Hideki learned something new, that this world cannot be fixed with words; he learned that the world can only be fixed with action; actions that impact the rules and the people like an asteroid hitting Earth. He returned to his home and started reading the ancient book that Satoshi gave him.Little did Hideki know, Satoshi was alive and had another student, let’s call him “Person B”. Satoshi had a thing of not telling his students about his other students which meant that neither Hideki nor Person B knew eachother. Hideki leaves for a trip and Person B comes back from a trip and vice versa always happened.Person B was very poor and Satoshi used to give him food and shelter. Satoshi taught Person B some “time-space manipulation” group of techniques and “physical amplification” group of techniques which Person B had mastered.When Satoshi was caught in the city-wide destruction due to terrorist attack where Hideki couldn’t find him and finally snapped, he was too far away from Hideki and Person B found him.Finally, Satoshi told Person B about Hideki about just 4 days later when he could see Person B. Person B went to Hideki’s home but didn’t found him as he was training in the forest.Since Satoshi’s home was destroyed by the terrorists even though he lived in a forest, Person B bought him an apartment even though Satoshi didn’t ask for the apartment.The book that Satoshi gave told Hideki everything about Soul Energy and the “Time-Space manipulation group of techniques”. He trained day and night, without eating and without ever taking a break for decades, and mastered his abilities. After decades of training, his techniques were now Spatial cuts and travelling cuts which he can use more than 5000 times a second, spatial destruction, now 500m in volume, spatial collapse and expansion which can now collapse and expand matter which only the legendary figures can counter, telekinesis with the max range of 200km and can lift 20 kilotons, teleportation with the range of 200km, spatial mapping, unrestricted spatial mapping (5km radius), omnipresence, unrestricted omnipresence (1.5km), spatial distortions, a technique which distorts space to the point that it collapses and expands the matter which occupies that space violently which makes shockwaves, telekinetic repulsion which repels incoming physical attacks within a 5m radius of him with the force of 5000 newtons (he can increase it), time-slow and regeneration and not aging.The First attack that Hideki did that was equivalent of an asteroid with the diameter of 50m hitting at 65 km/s which yields an explosion equivalent to 100 megatons of TNT with blades flying everywhere. It was done by using spatial cuts and travelling cuts, unrestricted omnipresence (1.5km radius), spatial distortions and telekinetic repulsion with Hideki giving it all. Hideki came out uninjured but the surrounding? 5 cities were obliterated with 5 million casualties within a 150 km radius.Hideki’s name became feared and once people knew that he was LSET person, they hated lower soul energy output people more but after some time, they started respecting them as Hideki was doing what even VHSET people couldn’t. After more learning, Hideki made his unrestricted spatial mapping (10km radius) and unrestricted omnipresence (2km). Unrestricted Omnipresence of this size made Hideki very weak and could potentially kill him from exhaustion and soul “heat”.Hideki’s last attack took place in a very crowded city surrounded by 5 other cities. He used the same combination of technique as done before in his first attack but scaled it higher. The explosion was of 250 megatons of TNT with 20 million casualties from spatial cuts and travelling cuts alone. In total, 500 million casualties were recorded. After the attack, Hideki was exhausted and his soul was “very high in temperature”. A person with thousands supporting them to give them soul energy appeared and distracted Hideki. While the thousands performed a ritual to split Hideki’s soul into 4 parts with each part having it’s own personality and having 25% of Hideki’s techniques’ power. The 4 parts could not gain any more techniques but could gain more mastery and soul energy. If one of the 4 dies then their part of the soul and power would be given to a random part.Since, the 4 parts of Hideki’s soul could not age due to Hideki’s “not aging” technique, they lived for thousands of years. People feared and hated them, but later accepted them. The 4 parts became warriors after thousands of years and fought legendary battles. The People gave them soul energy for battles against alien civilization. One day, a powerful human warrior sent by an empire with “time-space manipulation” group of techniques. The Warrior killed 3 of the 4 parts of Hideki and the final part of Hideki had 5 times the power Hideki had due to people giving them soul energy but the 4th part lacked mastery to Hideki’s level.A battle began, one-side there was The Human Warrior and on the other, the 4th part of Hideki. After a long fought battle, the 4th part lost and that should’ve been the end… but Hideki’s soul’s determination and willpower was in the insane amounts. Hideki’s soul due to soul “mass” increasing by determination and willpower, regenerated a new body with clothes but now with Hideki’s mastery and the new VHSET power.On Hideki’s comeback, due to Hideki’s “telekinetic repulsion” technique not being tuned to the new VHSET power, and being tuned high up because of the battle that happened with him against the person with thousands supporting them thousands of years ago, his technique violently repelled everything around him. 50m radius was a crater, and the 2km radius was flattened out with The Human Warrior being repelled 5km away. Hideki soon, easily killed The Human Warrior.Hideki saw that people now had began to respect lower soul energy output people and finally felt peace. Hideki then learned about the empire that sent The Human Warrior.The Empire that sent The Human Warrior was named “The Higher Empire”. The Higher Empire then declared war on Hideki and now… Hideki’s techniques are Spatial cuts and travelling cuts, regeneration (basically instant), time-slow, spatial mapping, unrestricted spatial mapping (20km radius), omnipresence, unrestricted omnipresence (5 km radius), telekinesis (max range = 250km) can lift 10^14 tons, teleportation (max range = 500km), spatial distortions (now 5x stronger than usual m), spatial collapse and expansion (20x), spatial destruction (250m cubed volume), infinite spatial cuts and travelling cuts, maximum spatial destruction (can only do it with the power with sacrificing 95% of his soul energy) it destroys space within a 2.5km radius with black colored fractals tendrils extending out and average length of them being 5km and max being 20km with the spatial shockwaves able to do enough damage on a planet that a 10km asteroid going 80km/s does. Hideki was now the Strongest Mortal of All Time, known as “Mortal God” and “The Devil”. All of Hideki’s techniques if Hideki isn’t precisely tuning them for safety which he isn’t doing 95% of the time cause massive collateral and environmental damage which is very self-explanatory.After centuries long battle, Hideki won against The Higher Empire but a new opponent with “time-space manipulation” group of techniques appeared. The Second Strongest of all time who challenged Hideki into a death battle which Hideki accepted. Mid fight, The Second Strongest of All Time was possessed by The God. The battle turned into a “The Devil vs The God” they were both equal. Their fight’s collateral and environmental damage should’ve wiped out multiple civilizations if they weren’t fighting on a barren <a href="http://planet.At">planet.At</a> last, Hideki sacrificed 95% of his soul energy to use maximum spatial destruction. Hideki used maximum spatial destruction, infinite spatial cut and travelling cut, spatial collapse and expansion, unrestricted omnipresence (2.5km radius), and spatial distortions on The Second Strongest of All Time which obliterated their body and The God knew Hideki won and stopped puppeteering The Second Strongest of All Time’s soul. This fight is known as “The Greatest Fight to Ever Happen” and “The Devil vs The God”. The Anomaly watched that fight (although nobody knows).Hideki after the battle was exhausted to the point of not being able to move his body and on the brink of death due to soul “heat”. Later, Hideki came back. Only years after the battle, all the civilizations started to collapse and the last modern and futuristic civilization collapsed due to war. Before the collapse, a group of people made a 2 feet wide, 4 feet long and 1.5 foot thick book with text, diagrams, drawn images and illustrations of legendary figures were written and planted in a planet where they knew a human-like civilization with human like people would emerge. Hideki also went to that planet and watched for thousands of years. The Book was named "The History of an Era"Thousands of years later, the human-like civilization found “The History of an Era” book when things started to get modern (just when smartphones were invented). While Hideki lived in an unknown cave. Hideki now can’t use 98% of his abilities and can only use telekinesis (max range 5km) can lift 4 tons at max, teleportation (max range 5km), spatial cut and travelling cuts, regeneration (very slow), and his own version of “outward burst” technique which at max can deliver a 500 kg of TNT explosion radiating outwards from his hands.# presentIn the present time, news have exploded about the book saying <code>NEW ANCIENT BOOK DEPICTING ANCIENT FIGURES FOUND.the book's title was written in an unknown language at first but later archeologists identified it and revealed to the public; the title of the book.[BIG_FONT] The History of an Era [BIG_FONT]As the title says! It is a book containing the history of an era!Truly a remarkable discovery</code>. The Archeologists and Scientists have a suspicion that something weird (Soul Energy) exists which only a specific group of people know about and they are a secret group. The Group of People that know about Soul Energy are SE (Soul Energy) users, in short form, SEUTS. SEUTS have found out about the book and are planning to get it.# Hideki’s full potentialHideki would have all of his abilities (in the fight of “The Devil vs The God”) on average, multiplied by 5000 and would have 4 new groups of techniques which only he has mastery of that level. The 4 new groups of techniques would be “life and death manipulation”, “physical amplification” which is his own version, “unfathomable speed” which is boosted by other techniques and “master SE” which makes him learn and his mastery of Soul Energy is even more good. He now has access to 500 spatial dimensions at least using The Fracture. His most powerful attack would be using maximum spatial destruction by sacrificing all his soul energy output while in 500+ dimensions.# The FractureWhen a technique from the “time-space manipulation” group shatters space, the hole that forms is called “The Fracture”. If one enters The Fracture, they would be transported to one added to their current number of dimensions.</p>
