# OmniGod
OmniGod is nigh-omnipotent. And he is friends with Sans (my one).he is the reason the lesser gods are not dead.
He looks like another Sans but his skull is black and his eye sockets are
white and his jacket is black and white.
His Jacket is long so long that is looks like an overcoat.

# God404
God404 is a god who is nigh-omnipotent. But much stronger nigh-omnipotence. God404 is a destroyer that destroys creation and
destruction. He looks like a Sans but he is black and white and he wears
what the emperors wear like with a lot of designs with some modern
look.

# The Infinite
also known as `The Infinite God` it is a being with the power of every single nigh-omnipotent being that do exist, do not exist, can exist,
cannot exist, beyond, transcendent, and every imaginable and
unimaginable. it looks like every single nigh-omnipotent that exists,
beyond and transcendent combined. It is close to being omnipotent, so
much so, that it is wrong to say `The Infinite One is nigh-omnipotent` and you still cannot say `The Infinite One is Omnipotent`
it is beneath omnipotence but above nigh-omnipotence. It was created by a random true omnipotent being. It is friends with Sans (my one).
