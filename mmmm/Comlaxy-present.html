<p>He is a skeleton wearing white shirt and dark red colored jacket. He wears black trousers with dark red stripes. His eyes are a circle made by 1 ring which is color dark red. This depends on his form. On the normal form he only has 1 ring to form his eyes. On form 2 he was two rings with distance always 1 cm from the outer ring which varies because if his eye shrinks then the distance shrinks too. And so on but on form 8 he has a full circle with a diamond shape on the middle.</p>
